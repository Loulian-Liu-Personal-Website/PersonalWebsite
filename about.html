      <h2>Please, no excessive moaning...</h2>
      <p>I like to pick up weights at least six days a week. Preferably I put the weights back and/or not give myself crippling injuries. Currently trying to reach the 1000lbs club by the end of 2023. Progress ain't going too well though heh.</p>
      <p>"Gain Muscle, Not Injuries (hopefully)" -also Someone Smart (2023)</p>

      <p>Building keyboards is a goal hobby of mine. Why goal? Because it's a super expensive hobby and one day I hope I can afford keyboards for all 17 sets of arms I have.</p>

      <h2>Wanabe Steak Connoisseur</h2>
      <p>Once upon a time, I cooked a very poor quality steak with above average flavor, but the pictures my girlfriend took of it were so good that they looked like stock photos for a steak house.</p>
      <p>Queue: me wanting to make a steak that feels and tastes as good as it looked in the photo.</p>
